## üìã Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google API Key (for Gemini)
- Internet connection for fetching stock data

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indian-stock-analysis.git
   cd indian-stock-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy yfinance langchain langchain_community langchain-google-genai google-generativeai python-dotenv scikit-learn plotly pydantic chromadb gradio sentence-transformers
   ```

3. **Set up Google API key**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python combined.py  # If you've converted the notebook to a script
   # Or
   jupyter notebook combined.ipynb  # To run the notebook
   ```

## üîç Example Prompts to Try

Try asking the assistant these questions:

- "Show me all Nifty 50 stocks"
- "List the top 10 performing midcap stocks"
- "What are the smallcap stocks with positive momentum?"
- "Give me stocks with normalized z-score rank from smallcap"
- "Show microcap stocks with highest ranks"
- "Compare Reliance and TCS performance"
- "Which stock has the best momentum in the midcap category?"
- "Show me stocks with RSI above 60"
- "List stocks with positive 6-month change but negative MACD"
- "What's the analysis for HDFC Bank?"

## üìä Data Structure

The application organizes stock data into four main categories:
- **Nifty 50**: Large-cap stocks representing India's top 50 companies
- **Midcap 150**: Mid-sized companies with good growth potential
- **Smallcap 250**: Smaller companies that can offer higher growth (and risk)
- **Microcap 250**: The smallest public companies in the analysis set

Each stock is analyzed with these technical indicators:
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Price momentum (20-day)
- 1-Year and 6-Month price changes
- Momentum rankings (relative to peers)
- Z-scores (statistical outperformance)

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance
2. **Technical Analysis**: Calculates indicators, momentum metrics, and rankings
3. **Vector Embeddings**: Creates searchable embeddings from stock reports
4. **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieves relevant information based on user queries
5. **LLM Integration**: Uses Gemini to generate natural language responses
6. **Interactive UI**: Presents information through a Gradio interface
